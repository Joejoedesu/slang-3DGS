# slang-3DGS
3D Gaussian Splatting Implemented in Slang

## Project Goal
Implement a basic version of 3DGS in Slang
For compatibility and easiness of debugging, start with slang-py
- Mile Stones
  - Single Gaussian Optimization with slang-py in a synthesized scene
  - Multi-Gaussian Optimization with slang-py in a synthesized scene
  - Re-optimization of a real scene from 3DGS paper with slang-py
  - Export and test the slang code compiled in a rendering language (HLSL)
  - 3D scene reconstruction using slang-py code as a plug-in for the original 3DGS code
